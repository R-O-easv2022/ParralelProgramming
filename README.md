This Compulsory Assignment is prepared by one student **Rolan Ossi**.

#Exercise 1: ConsoleApp5.sln
-------------
The program is able to find prime numners using a sequential approach. But the time of running from 1.000.000 - 2.000.000 is long.


#Exercise 2: ConsoleApp5.sln
-------------
The program is able to find the prime numbers using parallel programming. This method is so fast and can calculate the total number of primes (total primes between 1.000.000 - 2.000.000 = 148933) and that can be done in 116ms.


#Excercise 3: ConsoleApp5.sln
--------------
Following the both method sequential and parallel is done in range of 
a. 1 – 1.000.000
b. 1 – 10.000.000
c. 1.000.000 – 2.000.000
d. 10.000.000 – 20.000.000


#Excercise 4: WinFormsApp2.sln
--------------
A GUI is created and is able to check the entered number if it is Prime or Not Prime.
